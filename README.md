# Stock-Prediction-Using-LSTM-and-ML-Methods
This project explores the usefulness of sentiment data from Twitter to predict stock prices. Researchers collected tweets related to specific stocks or companies and employed the Twitter-XLM-roBERTa-base model for sentiment analysis. The sentiment analysis categorized tweets as positive, negative, or neutral, providing insights into public opinion. The study integrated this sentiment data with historical stock prices to train machine learning (ML) models, which comprise of Extreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost), Convolutional Neural Network - Long Short-Term Memory Hybrid model CNN-LSTM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). By comparing the models' performance using root mean squared error (RMSE). In terms of predicting stock values, the CNN-LSTM algorithm performed better. The study suggests that combining sentiment analysis with machine learning techniques can offer valuable insights for stock market forecasting, with sentiment analysis revealing public sentiment and the ml algorithms leveraging sentiment analysis and historical data for future price predictions.
